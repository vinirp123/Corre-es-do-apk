# Third-Party Notices

This project vendors third-party software and contains modified third-party
derivatives. Keep this file with source and binary distributions of CTR Native.

## PsyCross / Psy-X

Source: <https://github.com/OpenDriver2/PsyCross>

PsyCross provided the starting point for parts of CTR Native's
Psy-Q-compatible PS1 hardware abstraction layer, including compatible GPU, GTE,
SPU, CD, and controller library interfaces. CTR Native now owns those headers
and native platform implementations in `include/` and `platform/` while
preserving Psy-Q-shaped APIs.

CTR Native contains modified/project-owned PsyCross derivatives in these
component areas:

- `include/psx/`: Psy-Q-compatible facade headers
- `include/platform/`: native GPU/renderer facade types and support headers
- `platform/`: native PS1 facade implementations, GTE/GPU/render support,
  platform shell code, and generated GL loader sources

Individual source files may carry narrower provenance notes where the original
PsyCross source path is useful during maintenance.

## PSn00bSDK

Source: <https://github.com/Lameguy64/PSn00bSDK>

Path: `include/psn00bsdk`

CTR Native vendors a small PSn00bSDK header subset for PS1/Psy-Q-compatible
types, constants, and inline helpers used by the shared source. CTR Native does
not vendor or link `libpsn00b` into the native PC executable.

This notice applies to PSn00bSDK core files only. `mkpsxiso` and `dumpsxiso`
are separate GPLv2-or-later tools and are not distributed as part of CTR Native.
